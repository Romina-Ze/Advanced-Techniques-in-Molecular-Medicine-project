## Project Overview

This project explores the use of deep learning, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to predict RNA reactivity and molecular structures based on experimental data from chemical probing. It was developed as part of the **Stanford Ribonanza RNA Folding Competition** and highlights the power of machine learning in decoding complex biological data.

## Background

RNA plays a vital role in biological functions, and understanding its structure is essential for both fundamental biology and therapeutic innovation. Traditional experimental techniques are limited by time, cost, and scale. This project leverages deep learning to overcome those challenges by predicting RNA structure-reactivity from sequence data.

## Methods

- **Model**: Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- **Framework**: Python + PyTorch
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data**: 162,133 RNA sequences from Stanford's competition, with chemical reactivity profiles for DMS and 2A3
- **Training Strategy**: 4 experimental setups with varying depth and hyperparameters  
- **Validation**: Loss tracking via Mean Squared Error (MSE), with insights into overfitting and generalization
